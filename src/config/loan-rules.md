## Interest Rate Cap

When commercial market rates are lower than RPI+3%, a cap is applied. The cap is based on Bank of England data and reviewed monthly.

## Key Points

- Repayments only when earning above threshold
- Repayment = 9% of income OVER threshold (not total income)
- Interest accrues regardless of repayment status
- Multiple loans = single repayment split between them
- Self-employed: repayments via Self Assessment
