  # Repayment Thresholds (2024-25)
  # You only repay when earning above these amounts
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  threshold:

  # Upper threshold - above this you pay max interest rate

  # Interest Rates (1 September 2024 - 31 August 2025)
  # Based on RPI (Retail Price Index) + up to 3% depending on income
  #
  # How it works:
  # - Income ≤ £28,470: charged RPI only (4.3%)
  # - Income £28,471 to £51,245: sliding scale from RPI to RPI+3%
  # - Income ≥ £51,245: charged RPI + 3% (7.3%)
  #
  # Interest is added MONTHLY, even if income is below repayment threshold
